## B21: Deep learning analysis and augmentation of medical images under Albert Hsiao
**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic was the the fact that we used images and that we had a CNN trained on these images. I haven't dealt with something like that in this scale so I thought it was really cool.  
**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
I think it would be really cool to delve into the possibilities of finding ways to make it faster to process these images as they are extremely big which then cause very long processing times.  
**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
Honestly I would do it similarly; however, instead of doing it all in a jupyter notebook I would probably do it all as a script to make it reproducible.  
**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I think it would be cool to use data engineering as a practice to maybe use the CNN model in the pipeline to essentially allow the scientist to just plug in an image and then get the predictions from the model.
